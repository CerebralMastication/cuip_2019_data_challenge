# CSCDC Dataset

## Overview

The CSCDC (CUIP Smart City Data Challenge) Dataset is a dataset compiled from a month of data generated by the CUIP Testbed. This dataset contains a full month of Video Events (events being objects which pass through the cameras' view points). In addition, the dataset includes 23 days of Air Quality Data (a week shy of the whole month of June) - this is where the challenge takes place. Your challenge is to generate the last week of air quality data as accurately as possible using the prior three weeks and the vehicle event data. How you design your model is completely up to you!



### Video Event Format

Video Events includes data such as the event timestamp (in UTC), hit counts (how many times the object was found in this view), label (i.e. car, bus, person), event metadata (such as `pole_id` (`str`), `intersection` (`bool`), and `camera_id` (`str`)), and `locations`. Locations is a string representation of a JSON object that will need to be parsed via your programming language of choice. For example (in Python):

```python
import json
.
.
.

for index, row in dataframe.iterrows():
  json_parsed = json.loads(row["locations"])
  # Proceed to iterate over locations, if necessary
```

Then you can refer to the stringified JSON object through your library and programming language of choice. The `locations` object is an array of objects, each of which contains a `timestamp` key (whose value is a UTC timestamp) and a `coords` key (whose value is an array of `float` values representing the `x1, y1, x2, y2` coordinates of the object at that given timestamp). The format looks something like this:

```json
[{
	'coords': [737.4640244784002, 504.27940776028055, 967.5611213071068, 617.4017094599545],
	'timestamp': 1559364547782
}, {
	'coords': [795.9374239359277, 520.6466453487443, 1083.5997557290896, 662.3173861308863],
	'timestamp': 1559364547982
}, {
	'coords': [849.109040463825, 532.7213710812812, 1187.8635329313645, 699.1199888926651],
	'timestamp': 1559364548201
}]
```

This array is of **variable length**; some objects may have more objects within this array than others. The length of the array is the same as the `hit_count` value of that event.

### Air Quality Format

Air Quality Data includes data points such as `current_dewpoint_f`, `current_humidity`, `current_temp_f`, `lat`, `lon`, `timestamp`, `nicename` (the name of the sensor, this is similar to the `camera_id` of video events so this will help draw a correlation), and actual air quality values. An explanation of those values:

```
Pm1_0_atm: Channel A ATM PM1.0 particulate mass in ug/m3
Pm2_5_atm: Channel A ATM PM2.5 particulate mass in ug/m3
Pm10_0_atm: Channel A ATM PM10.0 particulate mass in ug/m3
Pm1_0_cf_1: Channel A CF=1 PM1.0 particulate mass in ug/m3
Pm2_5_cf_1: Channel A CF=1 PM2.5 particulate mass in ug/m3
Pm10_0_cf_1: Channel A CF=1 PM10.0 particulate mass in ug/m3
